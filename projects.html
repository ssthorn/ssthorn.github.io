          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>Shelling killed dozens of people in Kharkiv on February 28, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry reported. In Kyiv, the fifth day of the Russian invasion was marked by the reopening of grocery stores and public transportation after a tightened curfew. The United Nations estimates that more than 500,000 Ukrainians have already left the country. In Gomel, Belarus, delegations from Russia and Ukraine held talks that ended with the parties agreeing to meet again. Meduza shares snapshots from this day. <p>]]></description>

Since then, Russian officials have framed this attack a “special military operation” — although it is in fact a full-scale war (you can read the latest news about it here). In light of these events, we decided to take a look back on what Vladimir Putin has said about war during his 22 years in power. Meduza shares highlights from the Russian leader’s anti-war rhetoric here. <p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>On February 27, 2015, politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered in the center of Moscow. In the final years of his life, he advocated against the military conflict in East Ukraine, vocally supported the 2014 Maidan Revolution, and frequently gave interviews with Ukrainian journalists. In the months leading up to his murder, Nemtsov was working on a report about Russian military intervention titled “Putin: War,” which was posthumously published by his colleagues. To mark the anniversary of his murder, Meduza is publishing some of the anti-war statements Nemtsov made in the months leading up to his death.<p>]]></description>

Fierce battles continued on the outskirts of the nation’s capital, Kyiv, and in the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. For the first time, the Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged that its soldiers have been killed and wounded in Ukraine. After several false starts, Kyiv and Moscow, with mediation by Minsk, also agreed tentatively to meet for the first ceasefire negotiations. Meduza presents several photographs from this day in the War for Ukraine.<p>]]></description>

Yesterday, Russian troops advanced into Kyiv and continued shelling the city. As fighting took place on the streets of the Ukrainian capital, Meduza reached out to different Kyiv residents for eyewitness accounts of this past week’s events. Some of the people we spoke to were hiding in shelters, others had decided to join territorial defense groups, and some were evacuating the city altogether. Here are their stories.<p>]]></description>

Judging by similar measures the authorities have taken against Twitter, we know this might make the site significantly harder to use — photos and videos will probably take especially long to load. And it’s highly likely that the authorities won’t stop there. In the near future, we anticipate them blocking independent (and other) media outlets. Here are the things you can do right now to prepare for life in the new Internet reality.<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>On February 17, the breakaway governments in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions began spreading claims of a massive Ukrainian artillery attack on the territories they control. The leaders of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” used these claims not only to evacuate women and children into Russia but also to implement a universal conscription policy among men between 18 and 55 for “the protection of the Donbas and of all Russian people.” On February 23 and 24, the self-proclaimed republics reported a successful military recruitment campaign that allegedly brought in many new volunteer troops. However, local residents told Meduza that soldiers are conducting raids to sweep the streets for potential conscripts.<p>]]></description>

Poland, Moldova, and Hungary are all accepting Ukrainian refugees. Slovakia has declared a state of emergency due to the large wave of new arrivals. In addition, the United States has declared its readiness to help refugees, and Ireland has cancelled its visa requirements for Ukrainian arrivals. Here, Meduza rounds up photographs capturing the scale of the displacement crisis already in progress.<p>]]></description>

Russian state media outlets have also been silent on this front. Two anonymous sources — one at a major wire agency and one at a federal television channel — confirmed to Meduza that their newsrooms received a memo telling them to rely strictly on “official Russian state sources” in their reporting. These consist mostly of briefings held once per day by Russian Defense Ministry representative Igor Konashenkov. The journalists were also told not to cite any Ukrainian state sources, with an exception for announcements by the Ukrainian government about its own losses to Russian forces.<p>]]></description>

Several days earlier, Russian women began posting on social media that their sons, currently doing their mandatory military service in the Russian army, had been sent to the Ukrainian border and subsequently gone silent.

The Russian authorities often use these kinds of euphemisms to hide the obvious, calling their mansions “hotels,” dubbing members of the political opposition “extremists,” and labeling independent journalists “foreign agents.” We, however, believe in calling things what they are: Russia has begun a full-scale war against Ukraine.<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>On February 21, 2022, Vladimir Putin delivered a 56-minute televised national address that ended with his announcement that Russia would recognize the independence of eastern Ukraine’s self-declared separatist “republics.” The president spent most of the speech, however, contesting Ukrainian statehood and arguing that the government in Kyiv owes its territory today to the supposed generosity of the Bolsheviks, particularly Vladimir Lenin. To understand the scholarly merits of Ukrainian and Soviet history as presented by Mr. Putin, Meduza turned to Dr. Victoria Smolkin, a historian at Wesleyan University who studies Communism, the Cold War, as well as atheism and religion in the former Soviet Union. She is also the author of the 2018 book “A Sacred Space Is Never Empty: A History of Soviet Atheism.”<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>Russia recognized the self-proclaimed “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine on February 21. President Vladimir Putin formally announced the decision following a National Security Council meeting that looked more like staged production than an actual debate. Senior Russian officials expressed unanimous support for recognition, even though it appeared to be a sure path towards an all-out war with Ukraine. At the same time, Putin claimed there was broad public support for the move. Will we see a repeat of the “Crimean consensus” that emerged after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014? And how do ordinary Russians really feel about the Kremlin’s further intervention into Ukraine? Meduza turns to sociologist and Levada Center director Denis Volkov for insight.<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>The Kremlin’s handling of recognition for the self-proclaimed separatist “republics” in eastern Ukraine has raised many questions, including purely logistical uncertainties surrounding the National Security Council session, where President Putin ordered senior officials to state their support or opposition to the recognition of the so-called DNR and LNR. The gathering was made available to the public in an unusual national broadcast on Monday evening. At first glance, the event seemed to be aired live, but some noticed signs (such as the time displayed on different wristwatches) that the footage was prerecorded and even edited. These viewers were right.<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>Vladimir Putin has officially recognized the independence of the self-proclaimed “republics” in eastern Ukraine. The Russian president signed the corresponding decree on Monday, February 21, following a lengthy address to the nation. The issue of recognizing the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR) and “Luhansk People’s Republic” (LNR) was also discussed at length during an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Security Council earlier in the day. Speaking at the meeting, Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev suggested that Moscow recognize the “historical” boundaries of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions as the breakaway territories’ frontiers. However, this elides the fact that a significant portion of the territories the DNR and LNR claim remain under the control of the Ukrainian government.<p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>On Friday, February 18, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” announced that increased tensions in eastern Ukraine necessitated mass evacuations. Over the next three days, more than 60,000 people were relocated to Russia, according to official reports. In total, 43 Russian regions have agreed to take in evacuees. President Vladimir Putin has also ordered the Russian government to pay 10,000 rubles ($130) to each “refugee.” Be that as it may, confusion reigned at Russia’s reception centers over the weekend, as local authorities scrambled to accommodate the sudden influx of people. Several Russian regions have even declared a state of emergency. So far, evacuees are being put up in schools, hotels, summer camp facilities, and even makeshift tent camps. Meduza shares snapshots from the evacuation.<p>]]></description>

On Thursday, February 17, U.S. President Joe Biden said that there’s still a “very high” threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, warning that this could happen “in the next several days.” The Kremlin, meanwhile, underscored that it has no plans of backtracking on its demands for comprehensive security guarantees from Washington and NATO. Moscow raised the stakes again earlier this week when the State Duma adopted an official resolution urging President Vladimir Putin to recognize the self-proclaimed “republics” in eastern Ukraine. Meduza special correspondent Andrey Pertsev uncovers why this step was taken and how it was orchestrated. <p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Save Meduza!<br><a href='https://support.meduza.io/en'>https://support.meduza.io/en</a></p><p>On Wednesday, February 16, law enforcement officers raided the Moscow home of political analyst Valery Solovey. Solovey and his son Pavel were then taken to the Russian Investigative Committee for questioning. As it turns out, Solovey is considered a witness in a criminal investigation into felony hate speech. Solovey and his son were released late Wednesday evening after being questioned. According to unofficial reports, the felony investigation is connected to an anonymous Telegram account called “SVR General” — allegedly, Solovey may have been involved in creating content for this channel, which regularly criticizes the Russian authorities. Meduza recounts how Valery Solovey, a former professor at Moscow’s prestigious MGIMO University, became an extravagant political commentator known for his colorful (and increasingly wild) conspiracy theories.<p>]]></description>
