# ssthorn.github.io

1. Technologies: HTML for content. CSS for styling. JS and JQuery for additional functionality and styling.

2. Approach: The design is mobile-first.  I want the site to work well on a hendheld device, and read well as a dynamic business card of sorts. I want it to be fairly simple and functional, and flow in a pleasing manner without distracting elements.

3. live site: ssthorn.github.io

4. installation instructions: I don't think this project requires additional setup.


5. unsolved problems:  The parallax scrolling effect currently doesn't work on mobile, and I'd like to figure this out.
